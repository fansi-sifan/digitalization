## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. This file is to present a reproducible R analysis for the digitalization project:

### Set up

Load the occupation level data.
```{r occupation data}
load("occupation_scores.rda")
knitr::kable(occupation_scores[1:5,])

```

Filter the eligible ones that had a initial score before 2004 and an updated score after 2009. There are 595 of them.
```{r eligible occupations}
summary(filter(occupation_scores, eligible == 1))

```

Use box plots to see how distribution of digital scores have shifted
```{r boxplot}
boxplot(occupation_scores[3:4])
```

### Analysis
